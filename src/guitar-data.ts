    history: "This was the first guitar I ever owned.  It came to me in high school as a gift from my parents.  I remember starting to fall in love with guitar music through alternative and grunge rock.  A friend's brother was into music during that time, as a guitarist and drummer.  Through him I was introduced to a local band called Guilt by Association, and theirs were the first shows I ever attended.  We saw them play at the Cobalt, a ratty 18-and-over venue in Canoga Park, and later on a much bigger stage at The Key Club in Hollywood.  This, along with the tail end of the grunge scene that was still making air time on the radio at the time, convinced me that I needed a guitar of my own.\n\nMy parents supported my sojourn into music and this guitar became the one that started me on my way.  With it, I took music classes at my high school, jammed with friends and even once (hah) with Sean de la Tour (Guilt by Association's rhythm guitarist), and had my first experience modifying guitar equipment.\n\nOut of the box, this was a non-standard Squier.  The first time I took it to the shop, the guitar tech (Randy at Sam Ash, where the guitar was purchased together with a tiny Fender bass amp) noted the flame maple neck with rosewood fretboard.  He pointed out that sometimes, ironically, the factory would run out of the cheap parts and have to throw really nice stuff on the Squiers at that time.  (I guess this might have been a Chinese factory thing, as this model was a made-in-China specimen.)  In any case, to this day, that neck contributes to this being one of my best-playing guitars.\n\nOver time, I wanted more of that punk/metal feel, so I got a Seymour Duncan single-slot, dual-coil pickup installed in the bridge position.  I also started in pretty heavy with the aesthetic mods, starting with an over-spray of model car paint I had left over form my remote control racing days.  I went for silver with a schmear of blue in an attempt to evoke the Earth under a silver background.  Even this intentionally slopped paint job is now laid over with a variety of stickers and decals from all throughout the many chapters of my life.  In keeping with the punk aesthetic of the guitar, when it came time for a new tuner and new potentiometer knobs, I specifically chose mismatched items to give it that disjointed vibe.  Still one of my favorite guitars."
